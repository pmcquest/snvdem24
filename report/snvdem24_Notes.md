## Motivations for this study
- "What factors lead to democratization at the subnational level?" How our explanation fits into the broader literature, around democratization in general (55 competing explanations, according to @Coppedge (2012, Ch4)) and subnational research (@Giraudyetal2019).
- distal (e.g., harbors, Europeans, resources) and proximal factors complementary rather than competing. (Coppedge 2022) Is multi-equation path analysis feasible at the subnational level?
