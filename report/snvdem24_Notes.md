# Motivations for this study
- "What factors lead to democratization at the subnational level?" How our explanation fits into the broader literature, around democratization in general (55 competing explanations, according to @Coppedge (2012, Ch4)) and subnational research (@Giraudyetal2019).
- distal (e.g., harbors, Europeans, resources) and proximal factors complementary rather than competing. (Coppedge 2022) Is multi-equation path analysis feasible at the subnational level?

-- In contrast to this study, our project is more descriptive. Subnational levels of democracy in one country. And once we have the indicators of SN democracy, we can try to explain why development or HR outcomes occur. 

## Colombian subnational democracy
- Democracy has typically been measured at the national level, with few exceptions (e.g., Argentina, USA, Russia, Mexico, India). There are some exceptions, however.

## Methodological literature
- Difficult to interpret SN data. Our study introduces a clever way to extract fine-grained information. While V-Dem data groups at the national level, we are adding spatial information to it in order to disaggregate the survey. Latent understanding.
