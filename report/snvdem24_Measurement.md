# Measurement
_Unevenness_ will be measured using the latest V-Dem data on subnational elections and respect for civil liberties. These data are collected from two 2 surveys: Elections and Civil Liberties. An average of 5 country experts each respond to questions in these surveys, including 4 unique subnational democracy questions: 
1. _How would you describe the areas of the country in which elections are significantly less free and fair?_ **v2elsnlfc**
2. _How would you describe the areas of the country in which elections are significantly more free and fair?_ **v2elsnmrfc**
3. _How would you describe the areas of the country where government officials’ respect for civil liberties is significantly stronger?_ **v2clrgstch**
4. _How would you describe the areas of the country where government officials’ respect for civil liberties is significantly weaker?_ **v2clrgwkch**

Note that while these questions are complementary, they are framed to elicit an open range of responses consisting of nominal selections and textual comments. The nominal selections are dichotomous ones (0 = no, 1 = yes) for 21 different variables. These selections are then aggregated by coders to calculate the proportion of expert responses that selected “1” for a given variable. The results are country-year proportional scores for each variable, which could be interpreted as “levels of confidence” or agreement around the unevenness of subnational elections or civil liberties. Experts may also provide text comments that clarify their selections.

The subnational data from V-Dem are grouped into these categories:
1. V-Dem nominal responses
- Elections: v2elsnlfc, v2elsnmrfc
- Civil liberties: v2clrgstch, v2clrgwkch, v2clsnlpct
2. V-Dem textual responses
- Elections: v2elsnless, v2elsnmore; v2elcomsn (v3*), v2elcomcom (v3*)
- Civil liberties: v2clcommnt (v3*)

_* Note: "v3" refers to historical data from previous V-Dem surveys._
