MS// Intersections between them all. We can have around 20 variables, where there is yes-no on all of them. There is a tool to do this. 
MC// Values of the attributes: can these be automatically copied to sub-polygons? 
MS// Yes. On front end, we wont need to have the Municipal name for each. New table will have columns for each variables. 

MC// Luis Schiumerini suggests looking into machine learning, useful for figuring out the contribution that each variable has towards democracy. 
MS// Random-forest contribution maybe. Though there are few variables. There is not a lot of clarity to how much each variable contributes to democracy. 
MC// More familiar with latent variable models, using MLE. Simple arithmetic is another option. 
MS// We can try multiple methods, because the data is not so big. Processing should be easy. 

MC// We got comments data. After filling out the survey, many people clarify things. Urban-Rural. Maybe useful for validation. 

V14 is coming out early March 2024. Feb 12 will have an early copy. 

MS// I will download the shapefiles. OpenScience framework is more complicated than is worth.
