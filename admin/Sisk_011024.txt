Meeting with MS, MC
1/10

nominal areas: some geographic and some latent variables... 
- no geographic coordinates yet, PM will be doing this
- we need help with geographic files

MS// if data exist, there will be a lot of it though... 

Rural 
Admin or Pop density
- Bogota is a good example: city limits include a huge park... 
- pop density is based on Census data (recent); can be modeled global layer (Oakridge, or NGO source...)

Political data goes back to 1900; we would want coordinates back to 1900... but we can do by decade, even assume. 

MS has contacts from GIS data

Higher-lower income areas
- less historic data


Even a snapshot is worth doing


DV of development.. there are similarities
- JTurner: citizen proximity to state services, how this effects attitudes 
- Natan: criminal orgs and HR violations
