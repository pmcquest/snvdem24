Meeting with MS, MC, PM
1/10/2024

nominal areas: some geographic and some latent variables... 
- no geographic coordinates yet, PM will be doing this
- we need help with geographic files

MS// if data exist, there will be a lot of it... 

Variables under analysis: 
1. Rural vs. Urban
- MS// can be Admin or Pop density
-- Bogota is a good example: city limits include a huge park... 
-- pop density is based on Census data (recent); can be modeled global layer (Oakridge, or NGO source...)
MC// Political data goes back to 1900; we would want coordinates back to 1900... but we can do by decade, even assume. 

MS has contacts from GIS data

2. Higher and lower income areas
- MS// less historic data
- MC// but even a snapshot is worth doing

[We discussed the other relevant variables under analysis, and possible sources for where to find data]

PM// in this study, I am interested in the Dependent Variables of development
- MC// some similarity to Jake Turner's study on citizen proximity to state services, how this effects attitudes 
-- or Natan: criminal orgs and HR violations
