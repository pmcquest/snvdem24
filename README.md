# Repository for "Subnational democracy in Colombia" (snvdem24)
This is a repository for the 2024 project studying subnational democracy in Colombia, using V-Dem data. In this repository you'll find quantitative [data](data/), [scripts](scripts/) for data analysis, a collection of relevant [bibliography](biblio/) on subnational democracy and V-Dem, as well as a (rough draft) [report](report/). The repository also contains notes from team meetings as well as other [administrative](admin/) files.

# Description of project
-   **Objective**: Evaluate the relationship of democratic unevenness and development outcomes in Colombia.
-   **Hypothesis**: Development outcomes in subnational areas are correlated with free and fair elections, or with pressure from a mobilized civil society (civil liberties).
-   **Measurement**: Unevenness will be measured using V-Dem data on subnational elections and respect for civil liberties [2 surveys: (sub-national) Elections and Civil Liberties]. Development outcomes will be measured using Colombian Census data.
