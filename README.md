# This is a repository for the project studying subnational democracy in Colombia. 

# Description of project
## Objective: Evaluate the relationship of democratic unevenness and development outcomes in Colombia. 
## Hypothesis: Development outcomes in subnational areas are correlated with free and fair elections, or with pressure from a mobilized civil society (civil liberties).
## Measurement: Unevenness will be measured using V-Dem data on subnational elections and respect for civil liberties [2 surveys: (sub-national) Elections and Civil Liberties). Development outcomes will be measured using Colombian Census data.
