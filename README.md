# Description of project
-   **Objective**: Create a granular measure of democratic unevenness in one country (Colombia) using V-Dem.
-   **Relevance**: Method for systematizing background concepts included in subnational V-Dem survey questions. Can provide input for answering substantive questions, such as whether development outcomes in subnational areas are correlated with free and fair elections, or with pressure from a mobilized civil society (civil liberties).
-   **Measurement**: Unevenness is measured using V-Dem data on subnational elections and respect for civil liberties [2 surveys: (sub-national) Elections and Civil Liberties].
