  {"id":"coppedgeConceptualizingMeasuringDemocracy2011","abstract":"In the wake of the Cold War, democracy has gained the status of a mantra. Yet there is no consensus about how to conceptualize and measure regimes such that meaningful comparisons can be made through time and across countries. In this prescriptive article, we argue for a new approach to conceptualization and measurement. We first review some of the weaknesses among traditional approaches. We then lay out our approach, which may be characterized as\n              historical,\n              multidimensional,\n              disaggregated,\n              and\n              transparent.\n              We end by reviewing some of the payoffs such an approach might bring to the study of democracy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Coppedge","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Gerring","given":"John"},{"family":"Altman","given":"David"},{"family":"Bernhard","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Fish","given":"Steven"},{"family":"Hicken","given":"Allen"},{"family":"Kroenig","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Lindberg","given":"Staffan I."},{"family":"McMann","given":"Kelly"},{"family":"Paxton","given":"Pamela"},{"family":"Semetko","given":"Holli A."},{"family":"Skaaning","given":"Svend-Erik"},{"family":"Staton","given":"Jeffrey"},{"family":"Teorell","given":"Jan"}],"citation-key":"coppedgeConceptualizingMeasuringDemocracy2011","container-title":"Perspectives on Politics","container-title-short":"Perspect. polit.","DOI":"10.1017/S1537592711000880","ISSN":"1537-5927, 1541-0986","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",6]]},"language":"en","page":"247-267","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Conceptualizing and Measuring Democracy: A New Approach","title-short":"Conceptualizing and Measuring Democracy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S1537592711000880/type/journal_article","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"coppedgeDemocratizationResearchMethods2012","abstract":"\"Democratization and Research Methods is a coherent survey and critique of both democratization research and the methodology of comparative politics. The two themes enhance each other: the democratization literature illustrates the advantages and disadvantages of various methodological approaches, and the critique of methods makes sense of the vast and bewildering democratization field. Michael Coppedge argues that each of the three main approaches in comparative politics - case studies and comparative histories, formal modeling and large-sample statistical analysis - accomplishes one fundamental research goal relatively well: 'thickness', integration and generalization, respectively. Throughout the book, comprehensive surveys of democratization research demonstrate that each approach accomplishes one of these goals well but the other two poorly. Chapters cover conceptualization and measurement, case studies and comparative histories, formal models and theories, political culture and survey research, and quantitative testing. The final chapter summarizes the state of knowledge about democratization and lays out an agenda for multi-method research\"--","author":[{"family":"Coppedge","given":"Michael"}],"call-number":"JC423 .C7173 2012","citation-key":"coppedgeDemocratizationResearchMethods2012","collection-title":"Strategies for social inquiry","event-place":"Cambridge ; New York","ISBN":"978-0-521-83032-4 978-0-521-53727-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"number-of-pages":"357","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge ; New York","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Democratization and research methods","type":"book"},
  {"id":"coppedgeDrugsCivilWar2007","abstract":"Theorizing about the influence of modernization on democracy is once again in vogue. Nevertheless, this theme faces an important obstacle: the leverage of modernization hypotheses is generally modest. Key modernization variables, especially per capita GDP, almost always explain part of the variance in democracy, but rarely more than half. Also, as one can see in certain Latin American cases, economic growth sometimes has a negative impact on democracy. This paper argues that the impact of economic growth varies from country to country for systematic, not random, reasons. Using Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) in a cross-regional sample of 108 countries from 1978 to 1999, the paper shows that it is crucial to distinguish between the shortterm effect of per capita GDP growth within each country and the cross-national effect of long-term growth. A distinct causal mechanism is at work at each level of analysis. More precisely, the paper identifies four factors that condition the impact of economic growth on democracy: the existing political regime, the democratic experience of each country, the frequency of civil war, and the importance of drug trafficking in the domestic economy. Although other factors probably also condition the effect of the economy on democracy and democratization, the model used in this paper explains 82 percent of the variance in the sample, which is substantially greater than what is typically found in other studies of democratization. Consequently, this paper shows that it is necessary to continue to refine hypotheses about the conditional effect of the economy in order to improve conventional explanations of variation in levels of democracy, whether within one country or in comparative perspective.","author":[{"family":"Coppedge","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Alvarez","given":"Angel"},{"family":"González","given":"Lucas"}],"citation-key":"coppedgeDrugsCivilWar2007","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",10]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Drugs, Civil War, and the Conditional Impact of the Economy on Democracy","type":"manuscript"},

Este país, una vez la democracia más gobernable en América Latina, es ahora una democracia muy frágil. Después de estudiar los principales elementos de estabilidad de la fórmula venezolana, conocida como partidocracia, en una perspectiva histórica, Coppedge concluye que estas perspectivas son bastante reducidas. La sociedad venezolana está ahora más polarizada, la nueva coalición en el gobierno —el gobierno de Caldera— se encuentra fragmentada y dividida, y el anterior acuerdo entre los partidos parece ineficaz o éstos no desean apoyar al Presidente. Pero esto no quiere decir que la democracia esté a punto de quebrar en Venezuela, y este hecho dependerá del intento de Caldera por definir una alternativa con éxito al acuerdo adecopeyano.ABSTRACT: Coppedge analyzes in this article the prospects for democratic governability in Venezuela. This country, once the most governable democracy in lati America, i now a very fragil democracy. After studying the main elements of the stability of Venezuela's formula, known as partyarchy in an historical perspectiva, Coppedge concludes that these prospects are poor. Venezuelan society is now more polarized, the new governing colaition —Caldera's government— is fragmented and divided, and the former establishment parties seem either unable or unwilling to help the new Presidente succeed. But this does not mean than democracy is abot to break down in Venezuela, and this fact will depend on Caldera's attempt to define a successful alternative to the Adecopeyano establishment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Coppedge","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"coppedgePerspectivasGobernabilidadDemocratica2009","container-title":"América Latina Hoy","container-title-short":"Am.

  {"id":"mcmannExplainingSubnationalRegime2021","abstract":"Studies of a small number of countries have revealed that both democratic and nondemocratic subnational governments can exist within a single country. However, these works have neither demonstrated how common subnational regime variation is nor explained why some countries are more prone to it. This article does both. We show that subnational regime variation exists in all world regions, in both unitary and federal states, and in both the present and past, using Varieties of Democracy global data from 1900 to 2018. The article also demonstrates theoretically and empirically how social heterogeneity and factors undermining a national government's ability to extend control throughout a country promote this variation. Specifically, subnational regime variation is more common in countries that are ethnically diverse, rugged, and populous.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,6]]},"author":[{"family":"McMann","given":"Kelly M."},{"family":"Maguire","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Gerring","given":"John"},{"family":"Coppedge","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Lindberg","given":"Staffan I."}],"citation-key":"mcmannExplainingSubnationalRegime2021","container-title":"Comparative Politics","container-title-short":"comp polit","DOI":"10.5129/001041521X16007785801364","ISSN":"0010-4159","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"637-685","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Explaining Subnational Regime Variation: Country-Level Factors","title-short":"Explaining Subnational Regime Variation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/10.5129/001041521X16007785801364","volume":"53"},
